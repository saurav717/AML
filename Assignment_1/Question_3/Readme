QUESTION - 3

part a)
 
            compile using command - python DecisionTree_A




part b)

  	    compile using command - python DecisionTree_B_10
	


	    DecisionTree_B has 10 dataset divisions for cross validation
		
	    DecisionTree_B_15  has 15 dataset divisions for cross validation

    	    DecisionTree_B_20  has 20 dataset divisions for cross validation

	    DecisionTree_B_30  has 30 dataset divisions for cross validation

 	
	    There was an increase in average accuracy as the dataset divisions increased
	    
	    increase is not so high, accuracy increase has precision of 0.005
